== Description ==

Want to show a list of the top commenters on your blog? This lightweight, simple, and customizable plugin is it!

A simple way to show your appreciation for your community is to display a list of the top commenters on your blog's sidebar. Not only does it give them some link love back to their property but it also shows new visitors that there are conversations happening as well!

Here are a list of features:

  - Lightweight and well coded.  Low cost in terms of page load speed!
  - Customizable title
  - Can choose to show a particular "Date Range" such as Weekly, Monthly, or All Time!
  - Direct link to commenter's URL for some link love!
  - Option to show <a href="http://tentblogger.com/gravatar">Gravatar</a>
  - Option to hide the total amount of comments
  - Easy to customize via CSS for your own blog
 
We've taken a classic and typical need for a blogger and streamlined the code, simplified the options, and made it just easier to use!
